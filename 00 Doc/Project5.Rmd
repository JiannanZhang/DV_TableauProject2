####__1. Loading of R packages: RCurl, ggplot2, extrafont, jsonlite, dplyr, tidyr, extrafont, jsonlite, reshape2 (R code not shown)__

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(RCurl)
library (ggplot2)
library(extrafont)
library(reshape2)
require(jsonlite)
require(dplyr)
require(tidyr)
require(reshape2)
```

####__2. Data__
Data that is provided for Project2 was selected from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). This center provides information about all health care services in America. In this project, Jeffrey and Jackie are focusing on Medicare Providers and the medical charges for outpatient services in 2012. 

The data set can be found at [Medicare Provider Utilization and Payment Data: Outpatient](http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/Medicare-Provider-Charge-Data/Outpatient.html)

```{r}
source("../03 Data/df.R",echo = T)
```
####__3. Crosstabss created through SQL query in R__

The project requirements has requirements of displaying crosstabs using SQL query in R. The following crosstabs are rank, last value/max value & difference, nth value, and cumulative distribution.

__Crosstab #1: Rank__
```{r}
source("../01 SQL crosstabs/rank.R", echo=T)
```

From Rank crosstab, we can clearly see the rank of a specific medicial payment(on AVG) in each state. For example, a $738 medical payment is on the 10th rank in AK state. Therefore, this crosstab is very useful for us to visulize the rank for a specific medical payment in each state.

__Crosstab #2: Last value/Max Value Difference__
```{r,fig.width=12}
source("../01 SQL crosstabs/last_max_diff.R", echo=T)
```

This crosstab will partition by APC which are codes determined by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid to breakdown the different types of outpatient services (including level of service). We can see from here that in Arkansas has a max outpient services number of 25502 in Level 12 - Level I Debridement  and  Destruction. The crosstab goes through each Arkansas location and determine the difference between the number of outpatient services of that location and the max number of outpatient services. 

__Crosstab #3: Nth Value__
```{r,fig.width=12}
source("../01 SQL crosstabs/nth_value.R", echo=T)
```

From this nth_value crosstab, we can clearly see the nth value of the medical payment (on AVG) in each state as we want. For exmaple, if we want to see the fifth value of the medicial payment in each state, we can put 5 in the nth_value parameter.

__Crosstab #4: Cumulative Distribution__

```{r,fig.width=12}
source("../01 SQL crosstabs/cumediff.R", echo=T)
```
####__4. Crosstabs created through Tableau__

Below are sample crosstabs created in Tableau. 

#####__Rank Crosstab__

This crosstab will show the rankings of average payment cost, broken down by state and city descending.

#####__Last Value/Max Value and their Differences Crosstab__

This will show the current value, max value, and their differences for two states.

#####__Nth_value Crosstab__

The samples will shoe the 1st, 2nd,and 3rd Nth value among the average payment cost.

#####__Cumulative Distribution Crosstab__

Cumulative distribution among the outpatient services based on APC
